# A python based ilearn jlu client.

Just a single file ` iLearn.py ` . Run this program with `python iLearn.py`.

In general , you need mpv , python (>3.10) with modules requests , beautifulsoup (bs4) installed and correctly configured in your PATH . We recommend virtual environment like `venv` to install .

Use ` python -m pip install requests bs4 ` to install all modules.

For Windows Users we have packaged a portable mpv compressed in this directory . You can just unzip it and pull all files just in this directory . Ofcourse you can install mpv as you wish.

For macOS and Linux Users we recommend you to install mpv by yourself. See [mpv installation](https://mpv.io/installation/).
